This project showcases skills required to perform a CI/CD pipeline. 
These include:

Working in AWS
Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
Building pipelines
Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
Building Kubernetes clusters
Building Docker containers in pipelines

Here I have developed a pipeline that builds and pushes docker image to docker repository and then deploys the application in EKS using blue/green deployment.
